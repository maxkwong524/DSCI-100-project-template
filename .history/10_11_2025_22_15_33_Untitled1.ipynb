    "This assignment focuses on the broad question of Demand Forecasting (Question3): Predicting the time windows that are most likely to have a large number of simultaneous players in order to optimize license provisioning. The dataset comes with 2 files: \"sessions.csv\" and \"players.xlsx\". The sessions file contains individual player game sessions from start_time to end_time with the hashed emails as player identifiers. Variables like hour_of_day and day_of_week were extracted as important timetamps. The players file contains unique player records with their descriptive features like player age and gender. Since the core analysis is time-based the sessions file is used to derive time-series activity. A potential issue is an inherent lack of precision in the start_time and end_time not accurate enough to reflect the true time a player joins/leaves, it introduces uncertainty into the concurrent player count thus making the server demand data inaccurate and can be addressed through aggregating the concurrent count into large time bins to smooth out minor timing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific question formulated is \"What specific 1 hour window on which days of the week are most likely to experience a server load above the 75th percentile of average concurrent player count?\", the question identifies the concurrent player count (response variable) and the explanatory variables: hour_of_day and day_of_week. The relationship between time and load is visualized through plots. The overall activity is highest on Saturdays and Sundays and during the 2 time windows of 12am - 4am and 6pm - 11pm. The hours with highest concurrent players are in the late night and early morning (1am, 3am and 5am), peaking at 3am with ~0.82 players. This pattern validates the time-based variables usage for modelling. \n",
